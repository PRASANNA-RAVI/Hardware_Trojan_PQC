# SABER_HardTrojan

This is the source-code of the paper 'On Threat of Hardware Trojan To Post-Quantum Lattice-based Schemes: A Key Recovery Attack on SABER and beyond' accepted for publication in SPACE 2021 (December 10-13, 2021, Kolkata / IIT Kharagpur, India). 

In this work, we demonstrate the insertion of a Trojan in hardware implementation of the lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation (KEM) scheme Saber.
